==================
Getting Started
==================

This section is intended to help you get started with Augur. We will look at the steps to set up and install Augur. We will also look at how to use Augur.
Augur can be installed locally on macOS, Ubuntu and Fedora. It has been tested thoroughly for Ubuntu, so it is the preferred and suggested environment.
We have a dedicated page to set up augur in ubuntu environment where every step has detailed explanation.
We also have a dedicated page for installing it on all other systems.

Happy hacking!
